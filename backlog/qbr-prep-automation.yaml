title: QBR Prep Automation
submitter: Customer Success Team
department: CSM
submitted: "2026-02-20"
problem: >
  CSMs spend 8-12 hours preparing for each customer QBR. They pull data from
  multiple sources (Salesforce, product analytics, support tickets, NPS), massage
  the data, and build a presentation deck. Because they rarely have 8-12 hour
  blocks, prep happens over 2-3 weeks with constant context switching. The worst
  part: because it's so painful, CSMs only do QBRs for their top accounts. They
  should be doing them for all customers.
current_state:
  volume: "~50 QBRs/quarter (should be 200+)"
  time_per_qbr: "8-12 hours"
  team_size: 15
  tools: "Salesforce, Gainsight, PowerPoint, manual data pulls"
  pain_points:
    - "Multi-week prep with context switching"
    - "Manual data gathering from 5+ systems"
    - "Inconsistent deck quality"
    - "Only top accounts get QBRs"
desired_state: >
  AI gathers customer data automatically, generates insights, and produces a
  draft QBR deck. CSM reviews and customizes in 1-2 hours. Every customer gets
  a QBR, not just top accounts.
success_metrics:
  - "Reduce prep time from 8-12 hours to 1-2 hours"
  - "Increase QBR coverage from 25% to 100% of accounts"
  - "Standardize deck quality across all CSMs"
  - "CSM satisfaction score > 4.5/5"
